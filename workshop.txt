description=This mod adds ONTO the base game's calorie burning activities and tries to correct what are oversights. Specifically the fact running (jogging) is the only movement that burns more calories; walking/idling/sprinting all burns the same rate. Additionally, I want to make more grounded effects, like carrying heavy items for a while should burn more calories as well. These rates are subject to change and this mod is WIP.
